# MusicPlayerStimulation
🎧 MusicPlayerSimulator – A Java Console Music Player
I created a Java project named MusicPlayerSimulator that simulates a music player using core Java features like Multithreading, File Handling, and Object-Oriented Programming.
🎯 Key Features:
Plays songs one by one with time-based simulation
Allows the user to:
⏸ Pause
▶ Resume
⏭ Skip
🛑 Stop
🔀 Shuffle playlist
🔁 Enable looping
Logs each playback event into a text file (playback_history.txt)
Loads songs dynamically from an external file (playlist.txt)
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Java multithreading, input/output, file operations, and real-time interaction logic.
I’m proud to share it as part of my portfolio!
